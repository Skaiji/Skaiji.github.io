## SKAIJIDEV UNITY DEVELOPER

I am a Unity developer with more than 3 years of experience, on my account there are already more than 7 cool, launched projects. I develop both games and solutions for industrial business.

I actively follow the emergence of new technologies and am not afraid to apply them in development. When designing, I pay special attention to the structure and logic of interaction. I love clear, usable code, I prefer simplicity and minimalism.
